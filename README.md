A Totally Normal Word Game

Description:
A Totally Normal Word Game is a terminal-based word-scrambling game created by a development team with zero prior programming experience. Every part of this project was built by applying the lessons, activities, and examples taught by our professor throughout the course.
The game challenges players to unscramble words across multiple difficulty levels. Each wrong guess reduces the player's sanity, and once sanity reaches zero, a jumpscare is triggered using an image and sound effect.

How to Run:
1. Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your computer.
2. Install the required dependency (Pillow) using:
   pip install pillow
3. Place all project files, including the image and sound file, in the same folder.
4. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:
   python two.py

Features:
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Random word scrambling using Python's random module
- Sanity system that decreases with wrong guesses
- Jumpscare sequence with fullscreen image and sound
- Dynamic gameplay messages and timed pauses
- Simple level progression system

Our Dev Team:
- John Kenward Soriano – Project Lead; implemented gameplay mechanics, sanity system, and word shuffling logic.
- Andrei Domingo – Image integration, debugging, jumpscare window behavior, gameplay assistance.
- Nicholas Umlas – Jumpscare and sound designer, gameplay mechanics.
- Dwayne Martinez – Lead tester, UX design, gameplay mechanics support.
